*Abstract*

This report describes two methods to decompose an image in to a collection of splines of cubic Bezier curves.
For this the splines are interpreted as polymers moving in an environment which is derived from the image.
The Hamiltonian of the system is used to define a Monte Carlo model.
And the Lagrangian is used to find the equations of motion for this model.
The models are compared.
